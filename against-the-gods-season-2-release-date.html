The series follows the adventures of Yun Che, a young man who possesses the Sky Poison Pearl, a mysterious artifact that grants him incredible powers and abilities. Yun Che travels across different realms and worlds, encountering enemies and allies, as he seeks to uncover the secrets of his past and his destiny.</p><p>The first season of Against the Gods premiered on February 5, 2021, and consisted of 76 episodes. The series received positive reviews from fans and critics, who praised its animation, action, humor, and story. The series also gained a loyal fan base and a high rating on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDb</a>, where it has a score of 8.8 out of 10, based on 22 votes.</p><p>But will there be a second season of Against the Gods? And if so, when will it be released? Here is everything we know so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Renewal_Status_of_Against_the_Gods_Season_2></span>Renewal Status of Against the Gods Season 2<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of December 8, 2023, there is no official confirmation or announcement about the renewal status of <a href=#>Against the Gods Season 2</a>. However, there are some clues and hints that suggest that the series may be coming back for another season.</p><p>First of all, the web novel that the series is based on is still ongoing, with over 1,800 chapters published so far. This means that there is plenty of source material for the anime adaptation to continue. Moreover, the first season of the anime only covered the first 200 chapters of the novel, leaving a lot of room for further development and exploration.</p><p>Secondly, the popularity and demand for the series are high, both in China and internationally. The series has a strong social media presence, with over 300,000 followers on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, and over 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, where the official trailers and clips are uploaded. The series also generates a lot of buzz and discussion online, as fans share their opinions and reactions to the episodes.</p><p>Thirdly, the production studio behind the series, Shanghai Motion Magic, has a track record of producing successful and long-running Chinese anime series, such as Soul Land, Battle Through the Heavens, and Stellar Transformation. The studio is known for its high-quality animation, faithful adaptation, and consistent release schedule. Therefore, it is likely that the studio will continue to work on Against the Gods, given its potential and profitability.</p><p>Therefore, based on these factors, we can expect that Against the Gods Season 2 will be renewed sooner or later, and that the announcement will be made in the near future.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Against_the_Gods_Season_2_Release_Date></span>Against the Gods Season 2 Release Date<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>We can speculate that the second season of Against the Gods will premiere sometime in 2025, if it gets the green light</strong>.
